add everything to ini to configure easy

table:
make ini change color if theres a diff
make vbs change color if theres a diff (using vpxtool)
show romnameon rom column

year/brand/name get from vpxtool json (maybe some others too)

add coloring to row as in:
if a table fails to launch, paint it red
default is clear, if launches normally, make sure its clear (to remove red)

year = release date
brand = author
name = tablename
rom = romname
